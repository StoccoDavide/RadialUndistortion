# CUDA Radial Undistortion Kernel

In this repository, you can find a simple (and interactive) CUDA C++ kernel for
radial undistortion correction of images. This code was written in back 2018 
under the supervision on Prof. *Nicola Conci* (DISI - Univeristy of Trento). It
was my first experience with CUDA parallel programming, so take it with with a
grain of salt.

You can also find an updated report on the usage of such a CUDA kernel in the
`latex` folder.
