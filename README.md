# CUDA Radial Undistortion Kernel

In this repository, you can find a simple (and interactive) CUDA C++ kernel for
radial undistortion correction of images. This code was written in 2018 and is
my first experience with CUDA, so use it with (a lot of) critical thinking.

You can also find an updated report on the usage of such a CUDA kernel in the
`latex` folder.
